# Megaman Battle Network 5 Mini Map App

This app is a Windows only tool that reads MMBN Legacy Collection 2's memory and grabs current map ID from that.

Then it displays an image of the current room if that's present in the [images](/images/) folder.

The images were taken from [Dr. Cossack's Lab](https://www.interordi.com/mega_man_pc/games/mmbn5/) without anyone's consent.


# How to use

- Open the legacy collection 2
- Load up MMBN 5 (tested with Team Protoman)
- Open this app
- Use `Start`/`Stop` button to enable/disable memory reading.
- If you encounter an `Unknown` Room - press `Edit` it and give it a name.
- The name you've given will be used when loading images, e.g. when you're in the `Lan's Room`, the app will try to load `./images/Lan's Room.png` image.

The app should work under a regular user ***do not*** give this app (and 99.9% of all the other apps) admin privs


# Usecases

I dunno, having a map ready? Maybe for a stream? Does the reason have to exist?


# Legal Stuff

One word: **WTFPL**.

Assets are *not* included. Because...

***- Wait, did you *steal* the images? ~ The User***

> As stated above, the images were obtained from the internet w/o anyone's consent.
>
> We can argue all day about whether coding something means I can tell you what to do. Especially when the app in question uses assets made by other people and is useless without those.
>
> The same goes for the images. Yes, [Mega Boy](mailto:megaboy@sympatico.ca) did create the images used in this app, but does he own them? Can he (or Dr. Cossack for that sake) grant *any* persmissions regading Capcom's assets?

> Don't think so.

> It's not hard to ask, but I don't feel like there's any reason to.

> Dumping something from a game sure requires an investment of time - just as crating this app and writing this readme does. But neither of those acts magically makes any of us the owner of the assets in question. At best it's a derivative work akin fan art.

> If there's anyone to ask, that would be Capcom themselves. And we all know what they think (see [III. IMPERMISSIBLE USES](https://www.capcomusa.com/video-policy/)). Be happy Capcom doesn't enforce its rights and allows us to to what we do
